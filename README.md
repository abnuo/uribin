# UriBin

A self-replicating paste bin that lives in URL shorteners

## What?

A URI is like a URL except, rather than pointing to a file, it contains a file
encoded within it.

Some URL shorteners will let you "shorten" URIs. This means you can,
essentially, use the shortener as a free anonymous host for small files of any
type, including HTML with inline JavaScript.

UriBin is just such an HTML file. What makes it special though, is that it
facilitates the posting of a modified version of itself containing whatever
text you enter.
